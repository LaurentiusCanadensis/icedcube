Super Strong Copyleft Public License – Non-Commercial (SSCPL-NC) v1.0

Preamble:
This license ensures that the software and all its modifications remain free for everyone to study, use, and improve — but not for commercial exploitation. All changes must be shared rapidly, and network use counts as distribution.

You are granted the rights to use, study, modify, and redistribute this software solely for non-commercial purposes.

2. Strong Copyleft
Any modified version of this software, or any work that incorporates this software, must be licensed in full, under this exact license, to all recipients.

3. Network Use Equals Distribution
If you run this software (modified or unmodified) on a server or through any networked service for others to use, you must make the full corresponding source code — including all modifications — immediately available to those users without request.

Within 24 hours of deploying any modified version of the software — whether privately, publicly, or for internal use — you must publish the complete source code in a publicly accessible repository.

5. Upstream Sync Requirement

6. Patent Grant & Reciprocity
If you own or control any patents that read on the software or your modifications, you grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to all recipients. You also agree that if you assert any software-related patent claims against any user of this software, your rights under this license terminate immediately.

7. Open Interoperability
If your modifications create, use, or require any API, protocol, or data format to interoperate with the software, you must fully document and publish it under a license allowing free use and redistribution.

8. No Commercial Use
You may not use the software or any derivative work for commercial purposes. For the purposes of this license, “commercial purposes” include but are not limited to:
- Selling the software or access to it.
- Using the software to provide paid services.
- Incorporating the software into a product that is sold or licensed for a fee.

9. Termination
